    <p>
        By checking the "Accept" box and submitting this acknowledgment to the
        Environmental Data Initiative, you willingly accept the Environmental
        Data Initiative <a href="https://edirepository.org/about/edi-policy#privacy-policy">
        privacy policy</a> as stated on our project website. It is only
        necessary to perform this acknowledgment once. You may, however, be
        required to re-acknowledge your acceptance if we revise or modify our
        privacy policy. If you prefer not to accept the Environmental Data
        Initiative privacy policy, you may still browse our data repository as
        an anonymous "public" user, but you will not be able to perform any
        actions available to a registered user. Thank you for your support and
        use of the Environmental Data Initiative.
