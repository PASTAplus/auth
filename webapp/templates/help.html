    <h2>Overview</h2>

    The EDI Identity and Access Management (EDI IAM) Service allows you to control access to your
    resources in the EDI repository.

    <h2>Accounts and Profiles</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Each account (e.g., Google, ORCID) you use to sign in creates a separate profile in the EDI
        Identity and Access Management Service.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id='linking'>Linking Profiles</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Linking your profiles enables you to gain combined access to all resources across those
        profiles, while signing in to just one of them.
      </li>
      <li>
        The profile you are currently signed in to (shown at the top right) is your primary profile.
        The profile you sign in to during the linking procedure, becomes a linked profile. After
        linking, signing in to either will sign you in to your primary profile.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your primary profile keeps all its resources and gains access to those of linked profiles.
        Linked profiles also keep their resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you link an account already linked to other profiles, all those profiles become linked to
        your primary profile.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the account you link does not have a profile, one is created and linked automatically.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id='unlinking'>Unlinking Profiles</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        You can unlink profiles anytime from the <a href='{{ url('/ui/identity') }}'>Accounts</a>
        page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unlinking a profile causes it to become a primary profile, which you can sign in to
        separately again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your primary profile keeps all its resources and loses access to those of the unlinked
        profile.
      </li>
      <li>
        The unlinked profile also keeps its resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        No profiles or resources are removed.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
